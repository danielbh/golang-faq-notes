### purpose of go: 

- https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article : Why they made Go paper.

- the rise of multicore CPUs argued that a language should provide first-class support for some sort of concurrency or parallelism. And to make resource management tractable in a large concurrent program, garbage collection, or at least some sort of safe automatic memory management was required. 

- had become frustrated by the undue complexity required to use the languages we worked with to develop server software. Computers had become enormously quicker since languages such as C, C++ and Java were first developed but the act of programming had not itself advanced nearly as much. Also, it was clear that multiprocessors were becoming universal but most languages offered little help to program them efficiently and safely. 

-  One had to choose either efficient compilation, efficient execution, or ease of programming; all three were not available in the same mainstream language. Programmers who could were choosing ease over safety and efficiency by moving to dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript rather than C++ or, to a lesser extent, Java.

- Go addressed these issues by attempting to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. It also aimed to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing. Finally, working with Go is intended to be fast: it should take at most a few seconds to build a large executable on a single computer. To meet these goals required addressing a number of linguistic issues: an expressive but lightweight type system; concurrency and garbage collection; rigid dependency specification; and so on. These cannot be addressed well by libraries or tools; a new language was called for.

### ancestors of go: 

- some ideas from languages inspired by Tony Hoare's CSP, such as Newsqueak and Limbo (concurrency).

### go at google

Go is not the only language used at Google, far from it, but it is a key language for a number of areas including site reliability engineering (SRE) and large-scale data processing. 

### go with c

linking C with Go code gives up the memory safety and stack management properties that Go provides. Sometimes it's absolutely necessary to use C libraries to solve a problem, but doing so always introduces an element of risk not present with pure Go code, so do so with care.

### does go have a runtime: 

Go does have an extensive library, called the runtime, that is part of every Go program. The runtime library implements garbage collection, concurrency, stack management, and other critical features of the Go language. Although it is more central to the language, Go's runtime is analogous to libc, the C library. 

### Why does Go not have feature X?

Every language contains novel features and omits someone's favorite feature. Go was designed with an eye on felicity of programming, speed of compilation, orthogonality of concepts, and the need to support features such as concurrency and garbage collection. Your favorite feature may be missing because it doesn't fit, because it affects compilation speed or clarity of design, or because it would make the fundamental system model too difficult.

If it bothers you that Go is missing feature X, please forgive us and investigate the features that Go does have. You might find that they compensate in interesting ways for the lack of X. 

 ## Why does Go not have generic types?

Generics may well be added at some point. We don't feel an urgency for them, although we understand some programmers do.

Go was intended as a language for writing server programs that would be easy to maintain over time. The design concentrated on things like scalability, readability, and concurrency. Polymorphic programming did not seem essential to the language's goals at the time, and so was left out for simplicity.

The language is more mature now, and there is scope to consider some form of generic programming. However, there remain some caveats.

Generics are convenient but they come at a cost in complexity in the type system and run-time. We haven't yet found a design that gives value proportionate to the complexity, although we continue to think about it. Meanwhile, Go's built-in maps and slices, plus the ability to use the empty interface to construct containers (with explicit unboxing) mean in many cases it is possible to write code that does what generics would enable, if less smoothly.

The topic remains open. For a look at several previous unsuccessful attempts to design a good generics solution for Go, see this proposal: https://golang.org/issue/15292
